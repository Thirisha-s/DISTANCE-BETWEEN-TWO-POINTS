# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points


### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given


### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula


### Step 5: 
End the program


### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: Thirisha
#RegisterNumber: 22001920
import math
p1 = [10,6]
p2 = [4,2]
distance = math.sqrt(((p1[0]-p2[0])**2)+((p1[1]-p2[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
